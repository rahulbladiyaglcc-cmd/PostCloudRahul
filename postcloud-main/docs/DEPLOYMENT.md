# Deployment

Production uses the existing Dockerfiles and `docker-compose.prod.yaml`.

## Start Production

From the repository root:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up --build -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml logs -f backend
```

Stop production services:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml down
```

## Production Services

The production compose file runs:

- `postgres_db`
- `redis`
- `minio`
- `backend`
- `frontend`

The backend exposes port `5001`. The frontend exposes host port `3000` mapped to container port `80`.

## MinIO AIStor Free

Download the AIStor license file from MinIO SUBNET and place it at:

```text
secrets/minio.license
```

The license and MinIO credentials must not be committed. Configure
`MINIO_IMAGE`, root credentials, and the backend/OCR service-account credentials
in the deployment environment. Pin `MINIO_IMAGE` to a tested AIStor release for
production. The `minio-init` service creates the private document, profile, and
transient buckets and applies their restricted policies.

Start MinIO with the rest of the stack:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up -d minio
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml logs -f minio
```

The production console binds to `127.0.0.1:9001` by default. Access it through
an SSH tunnel:

```sh
ssh -L 9001:127.0.0.1:9001 user@server
```

Then open `http://localhost:9001`. Nginx is not required for this single-node
deployment. Add a TLS reverse proxy later only if the console or S3 API must be
exposed outside the Docker network.

## Required Environment

Provide production values for database, Redis, backend, frontend, JWT, encryption, CORS, and asset URL settings. Do not commit the production `.env` file.

## Migrations

Production should run committed migrations only. Do not run `migration:generate` in production.

Before running migrations from the production backend container, confirm the production image includes the migration config and runtime command. The current backend Dockerfile is optimized for `npm run start:prod`, so production migration execution may need a dedicated release step or image adjustment.

## Checklist

- Production `.env` exists on the server and is not committed.
- `secrets/minio.license` exists on the server and is not committed.
- `JWT_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` are strong production secrets.
- `MINIO_ROOT_USER` and `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` are strong production credentials.
- Backend and OCR MinIO access keys are configured with different strong secrets.
- `CORS_ORIGINS`, `VITE_API_URL`, and `VITE_ASSET_URL` match the deployed domain.
- Database backups exist before migrations.
- Images are rebuilt after dependency or Dockerfile changes.
- Logs are checked after startup.
